- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DK96-OS
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software, math, and physics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning project management with Confluence and Jira, developing a graphics engine, and creating financial tools for small businesses.
- I've also developed native Android app tools, some of which have gone out of date fast (thanks ViewBinding!).
- Explorer of many technologies and programming languages, confident in: C, JS, Python, Java, Kotlin
- In the future, I'd like to be more comfortable with Continuous Integration / Deployment, so that a higher percentage of my brain power can be focused on the main creative process.
