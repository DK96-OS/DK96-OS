### Welcome
- ðŸ‘€ Professionally, I am in the venn triagram of math, physics, and computer science.
- ðŸŒ± I am growing my ability to manage projects, by creating these open source projects.
- I believe these projects are worthy of support, and I welcome contributions and donations.

### My Top Skills
- Creating diagrams with equations and solving them.
- I am most confident in my ability to use `Kotlin`, and `Python`.
- There are others like `SQLite`, `C`, and `Java` that I have used a considerable amount.

### Experience
- I have spent many years learning the Android system and experiencing the evolution of libraries and documentation. Years of refactoring code, redesigning UI, and doing things the hard way.
- I have engineered and iterated Firestore database systems. Updated testing and handling migration while supporting multiple versions of client code.
- Open source project manager - is what I am growing into at the moment.
